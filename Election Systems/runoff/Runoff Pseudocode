Fin Min - Pseudocode

I want to iterate through the candidates and finde the one thats still in the election
and the i want to return the minimum number of votes for that candidate

I make a lowest vote variable and equal it to the first candidate

I check wether currend candidate lowest vote is more than the next candidate

if it is lower i update lowest vote to the next candidate
